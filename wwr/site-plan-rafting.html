            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Bringing to new people an activity that leads to sensations and emotions typical of actions that are carried out in open environments and over which one does not have total control.</p>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>My target clients are people/families with members over 15 years old who have a good financial situation and want to venture into a unique and unforgettable experience.
                Frequent questions:
                Will I be able to do it if I am a beginner? Our business has several plans adapted to the wishes and capabilities of each person. We also have courses and classes for those who wish to venture into this type of activities for the first time.
                What happens if I fall? Before each descent, instructions will be given on how to avoid falling into the water, safety positions and what to do in case it happens. Remember that we are protected by a buoyancy vest and helmet and our professional guides will be ready to come if you need help or rescue.
                I need glasses or contact lenses, what can I do? Contact lenses can fall and get lost, we recommend wearing glasses, if they have a cord to keep them in place it will be much safer.
